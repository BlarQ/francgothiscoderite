      <h2>A Chance Meeting</h2>
      <p>
      In 2022, Franc&apos;s attention was captivated by Nassy&apos;s insightful opinions during the conversations on MyLamp.
      </p>
      <p>
      MyLamp, an organization for young professionals, is a vibrant group filled with ambitious individuals, each brimming with dreams and goals.
      </p>
      <p>
      Franc, a software engineer with a passion for solving complex problems, was there to expand his professional network. Nassy, a hospitality management specialist known for her creativity and charm, had been a member of MyLamp for over a year and was helping to organize the group.
      </p>

      <p>
      Their first encounter took place on a sunny February afternoon at Novare Mall, where they both waited to meet up with fellow members before heading to Indigo VI for one of MyLamp&apos;s get togethers. Nassy&apos;s eloquence and enthusiasm effortlessly commanded attention, leaving Franc mesmerized. Despite their brief introduction, Franc found himself smitten.
      </p>

      <p>
      During the journey to Indigo VI, Nassy&apos;s reserved nature sparked Franc&apos;s curiosity. He wondered why she remained quiet, her silence only fueling his admiration. Although their initial meeting lacked meaningful conversation, Franc&apos;s interest was piqued, and he became resolute in pursuing a connection with Nassy.

    <h2>The Cold Response</h2>
    <p>
    As the weeks went by, Franc&apos;s affection for Nassy only grew stronger. Despite her initial cold responses, he persisted in reaching out, seeking to deepen their connection. Franc confided in Rosemary, Nassy&apos;s friend and MyLamp&apos;s administrator, about his interest in Nassy. Though Rosemary expressed reservations about Nassy&apos;s openness to dating, Franc remained undeterred, turning to prayer for guidance.

    <h2>The First Date</h2>
    <p>
    After two declined dates and Rosemary&apos;s intervention, Nassy finally agreed to meet Franc. Their first date began with Mass at the Catholic Church of the Presentation GRA, followed by a moment of uncertainty; after the Mass, as Franc wasn&apos;t yet sure of what Nassy liked, he asked <q>so where would you like to go?</q> <q>Her response was shocking; you brought me out on a date without having a place in mind? I&apos;ll be gone in 5 minutes if you don&apos;t come up with something</q>

    </p>

    <p>
    Although this response was unexpected, Franc in his usual calm demeanor quickly recovered, and the date went beautifully. Nassy let her guards down after this date and warmed up to Franc.

<h2>The Blossoming Connection</h2>
<p>
As their connection deepened, they discovered shared passions for their Catholic faith, Opus-Dei, and old-school music. Franc was captivated by Nassy&apos;s insightful perspectives, finding her thoughts refreshing and stimulating. By May, their bond had grown stronger, and they spent more time together outside of MyLamp, exploring hidden gems and enjoying several dates.

</p>
<p>
In July, Franc and Nassy officially started dating, and their relationship flourished. They supported each other&apos;s ambitions, celebrated their successes, and balanced each other&apos;s strengths and weaknesses. Franc admired Nassy&apos;s creativity and resilience, while Nassy was inspired by Franc&apos;s simplicity, intellect, and dedication.

</p>
<p>
Their differing tastes in movies—Nassy&apos;s love for sci-fi and Franc&apos;s passion for Nollywood—added a fun dynamic to their relationship, leading to many playful debates and shared movie dates. As they navigated their differences, their love and appreciation for each other continued to grow.

<h2>Trials and Triumphs</h2>

<p>
Like any couple, Franc and Nassy faced their share of struggles. The pressures of demanding careers sometimes led to misunderstandings and conflicts. Franc&apos;s unpredictable schedule often clashed with Nassy&apos;s well-planned, detailed approach. Nassy would meticulously plan their weekends, only for Franc to discover last-minute work obligations that disrupted their plans. They had to learn the art of communication, understanding, and compromise.
</p>
<p>
They learned to lean on each other, realizing that their relationship was a source of strength. They celebrated small victories together and provided comfort during tough times, their bond growing stronger with each hurdle they overcame.

<h2>A Bright Future</h2>

By the end of 2023, Franc and Nassy had weathered several storms and emerged stronger than ever. They had grown both individually and as a couple, learning to appreciate each other&apos;s unique qualities and quirks. Their love had deepened into a profound partnership built on faith, trust, respect, and unwavering support.
</p>

<p>
  
In December 2023, on Nassy&apos;s birthday, Franc planned a special surprise. They had dinner at Mood, a cozy place overlooking the city. After enjoying a delicious meal, the waiter brought out a beautifully crafted cheesecake; her favourite. Nassy&apos;s eyes widened with delight, but as she looked closer, she saw the words Will you marry me? elegantly inscribed on the dessert. Franc, with a nervous but hopeful smile, got down on one knee and presented a ring. Nassy said yes. In her words <q>this is my most heartfelt and profound yes</q>
</p>
<p>
They began planning their future together, dreaming of a life filled with love, adventure, and shared dreams.
